Project 2: Assessing OMICs stability
------------------------------------

Aim: Evaluate if OMICs profile vary in time, and what are the potential drivers of these changes

1. Identify sets of OMICs signals that are stable in time
2. Identify sets of OMICs signals that vary in time
3. Explore the rate at which OMICs levels change
4. Interpret the involved (metabolic) pathways and possible mechanisms
5. Evaluate if these changes are related to exposures / exposure changes
6. Investigate the link between stable and variable signals across OMIC platforms
